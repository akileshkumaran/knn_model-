##  Dataset Description

### Dataset Name
Iris Flower Dataset

### Dataset Source
UCI Machine Learning Repository  
Originally introduced by R. A. Fisher in 1936.

### Dataset Overview
The Iris dataset is a classic and widely used dataset for evaluating classification algorithms in machine learning and statistics.  
Each instance in the dataset represents a single iris flower plant.

### Dataset Characteristics
- Data Type: Tabular
- Subject Area: Biology
- Associated Task: Classification
- Feature Type: Real-valued

### Dataset Size
- Number of Instances: 150
- Number of Features: 4
- Number of Classes: 3 (50 instances per class)

### Features Description
The dataset contains the following attributes:
- Sepal Length (cm)
- Sepal Width (cm)
- Petal Length (cm)
- Petal Width (cm)

### Target Variable
- Iris Species:
  - Iris Setosa
  - Iris Versicolor
  - Iris Virginica

### Dataset Details
- Each row represents an iris flower.
- One class (Iris Setosa) is linearly separable from the other two classes.
- The remaining two classes are not linearly separable from each other.

### Purpose of Using the Dataset
The Iris dataset is used to:
- Train and test the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification model
- Evaluate classification performance
- Compare KNN with other machine learning algorithms

### Preprocessing
- Dataset contains no missing values
- Data is split into training and testing sets using data sampling
