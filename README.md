# knn_model-
This project demonstrates the implementation of a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification model using Orange Data Mining tool. The workflow includes data loading, data sampling, model training, evaluation, and prediction. Along with KNN, Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models are also used for performance comparison.
